##Calculator is operational.

I decided to use a table and I styled the table data elements to look like buttons, rather than dealing with buttons. for 2 reasons:
  1:  Buttons can be a pain, especially if they form part of a form (not that these are in a form but the theory stands)
  2:  Table data elements will automatically form the grid of buttons we need for this calculator and will be easier to format than all the buttons.

###Note: I have not watched the videos for thisd at all. I only opened the first one to see what the appearance needed to be and I went on my own from there so don't ask about video content, I can't answer.
